## Printable plastic part of plug.
Idea it to put wires in that touch when in use.

Use at own risk! Not for high voltages or currents! Do **NOT** use this as 
information to use it, you have to know your electrodynamics and this is 
*not comprehenisive*, just some ways it can go wrong:

* voltages that cause a dangerous current in humans. (&gt;20V)

* currents that induce dangerous other currents.

* currents that heat up the plug setting it on fire. For instance if your 
  source is high current capable and the wires accidentally short, or there are
  metal particles in the plastic stock, or the currents are simply high enough to 
  heat it whatsover.

* other unexpecteds. Used it for a data connection that turned out to be
  critical or something.

Some voltage sources drop if the impedance attached is too low, like with a
human, however attach a little more capacity. 1mA &cross; 1ms = 1&mu C at 
1kV, you need only about 1&mu C/1kV = 1nF
