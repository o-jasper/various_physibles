# OpenHW logo in openscad

[From this thing](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27097) by padorange, 
in turn by derived from clothbot.  

It is and [ImplicitCAD](http://implicitcad.org/) file. However it turns out it
works with regular openscad too.

(this required near-zero work for me :) )

## Instructions

Usage afaics identical as in openscad;  

    oshw_logo_2d(diameter);  

And diameter defaults to 10mm. There is also an .stl in there.
