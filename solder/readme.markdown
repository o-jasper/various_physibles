## Soldering iron holder
The idea is to use tin can sheet metal to hold it. Current version is 2.5d,
a printable version would be better.

### TODO

It probably needs a lot of changes/complete rewrite.

1. List the parameters.

2. Insufficient indication that it can hold it.

3. This is only applicable for thick walls.
