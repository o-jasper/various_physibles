# Pool table

Pool table model with channels. Comes with split versions so you can print it
easier, suggest print the bottom with support and the top with support up-to
some level, so that there is no support in the channel.

Made it for a little competition. Actually since it was so small slic3r ditched
the playing area for some reason so i scaled it up vertically. I had also not yet
split it up.
