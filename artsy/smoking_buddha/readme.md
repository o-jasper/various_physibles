You first need to get the .stl from [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29188),
this model was made by Jeshua Lacock.(thingiverse account [3DTOPO](http://www.thingiverse.com/3DTOPO/designs))

NOTE: this goddamn thing is useless as long as openscad screws up 
generating the .stl, and implicitcad doesnt have importing either. .. 
I'd swear i had used openscad like this before..

TODO perhaps instead do it manually with blender.
