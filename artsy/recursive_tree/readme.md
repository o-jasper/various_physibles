# Openscad fractal tree
Inspired(not derived) from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4787
which was by [thingiverse user tc_fea](http://www.thingiverse.com/tc_fea); Tony Cervantes

The recursive tree is (spiral)vase-printable, the others.. well sortah.

**NOTE** with slic3r, at least as of `0.9.10b`, it has lots of difficulty if
`avoid_crossing_perimeters` is enabled.
