# J-head holder for quickfit and 

`jh_holder.stl` is the dual J-head holder for 'mini quickfit'.
(also to be used if you just want one)
`jh_holder_quickfit.stl` is for the actual quickfit by richrap, however it 
has not been tested.

You slide the j-head in sideways and then it drops a bit, a slider
(`jh_sliver.stl`) can optionally be used to hold onto it, hwoever if it is 
held down by the pusher this wont be needed.

### The pusher
The pusher - pushes a pfte tube down into the J-head, M3 screws go through the pusher
and `jh_holder.stl` do so. Currently it is designed for a bowden setup. 
A second pfte tube with a m5 nut screwed onto the end is inserted on the side.

Of course it might be something else than a m5 nut, as long as it fits and can hold
on. There is also a printable pincher this `jh_pusher_pincher.stl`. Note that you 
might want to ensure sufficient inner diameter using a drill bit.

`jh_pusher_whole.stl` is the pusher, *however* it basically needs support, which
can be annoying, for this reason it is split up into `jh_pusher_bottom.stl` and 
`jh_pusher_top.stl`, the latter has a slot on the side. These halves are pressed
together with the same screwing action as the pusher pushes down with.

Once the pusher is pushing the external pfte tube for bowden use should be still
able to removed or reinstalled, if the filament is retracted first.

## TODO/NOTE
* No testing on the 3mm version, tell me how it went.
* Figure out a way to make everything epically clear, with diagrams and shit.
