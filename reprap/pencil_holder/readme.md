# Pencil holder
Clamp that holds a pencil to a tube. Made it for myself to keep my pencil from
getting lost all the time aswel as having it near the filament to be able to
'tag' the filament so i can see its motion.

Really helps that it is tiny, it is done printing very quickly.

Hope the default sizes work out for you. I printed a version without the 
circles and the end where you hold the clamp. Hopefully the circles give the
user more grip.
