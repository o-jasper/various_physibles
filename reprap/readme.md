Extensions/upgrades/replacements for reprap monomendel, barely specific to it.

`filguide/` is filament guide that goes onto the x stepper. That stepper moves
up and down, but that barely causes trouble. However, filament does seem to slide
through 'earthquake style', building up tension and then slipping.
(i use `../onplank/spool_plank.scad` which is correctly placed so i dont need the
guide anymore.

`power_supply/` holds a box at a distance from a 'bookcase' plank and the wall.

`reprap_mount/` is a wip mount that you clamp on the carriage using the 
springiness of the clamp itself.

`tweezenknife/` is a clamp for one of the rods to put your tweezers on a magnet
and a knife in thin hole. It is currently too hard to get on it and doesnt hang
onto the rod well enough after without using some tape underneath.

`z-rod-holder.scad` is a mostly useless 'improvement' of the z-smooth rod.
