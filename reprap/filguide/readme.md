`x_stepper_filguide.scad` is a filament guide that fits a stepper. Might be useful if
you have a stepper in the right place. Generating an `.stl` is *currently broken*, 
however a release with a `.stl` is
[on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:76903?save=success).

`spool_slider.scad` is a thing that attached to the spool, not really used it
so not released.
