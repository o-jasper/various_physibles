# NOTE

It looks like the design i made wont not hold the calibration well at all, 
may still be useful if calibration doesnt really matter. Next version will
probably be totally different.

# Easily addable/removable endstop holder
I wanted to be able to use my reprap for drawing, but the pen sticks out way
lower than the hot end. Changing the endstop position was the obvious thing to
do, but this seemed fussy. Obviously the solution is a second endstop.

Hence this, which is an attempt to have a second higher endstop that can 
rotate out of the way, so i can choose whichever height that way.

It consists of:
* A slider with the switch.
* A thing that receives the slider and a M3 screw can clamp it down.
  It also rotates on some big hex nuts on the lower horizontal bar of the 
  reprappro so it can get out of the way.
* A thumbwheel is probably nice to have. You can use any M3 thumbwheel that 
  isnt too large. There is a thumbwheel file supplied, but it is because i didnt
  have any hex heads.

# Notes
Note git:f9ccc6ddbef07a46bed2583f9d806927bc803c30 contains a clamping version
the nut version is simpler and probably has better location accuracy.
