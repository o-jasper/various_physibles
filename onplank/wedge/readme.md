# Wedge to close the distance
It has a cube on it, which goes into the other part so that the wedge doesnt
move.

Some of the parts here dont yet, you can disable it
with setting the 'thickness' `t=0` otherwise:

`sw = 10` size of cube that goes into the 'slide clamp'. Advise usage of powers two.

`w=20` width.

`l=20` length on the plank.

`wedge(et)` where `et` is how much the slide clamp vertical space is higher than
the thickness of the plank. Of course if it is too low, you're better off using
tape.
