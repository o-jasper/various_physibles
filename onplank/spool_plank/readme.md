# Horizontal rod holding thing

Cares about plank thickness and minimum distance from the wall. 
You have to provide a sufficiently long rod to stick underneath.
(as usual  you can use tape/file a bit)

The rod isnt in there you have to make/find own of the correct length;
longer than `pl-2*dx = pl - 23mm`. The 'safety pin' isnt included either.
(Its from another print i heated a nail through)
