# Horizontal rod holding thing
Cares about plank thickness and minimum distance from the wall. 
You have to provide a sufficiently long rod to stick underneath.
(as usual  you can use tape/file a bit)

The rod isnt in there you have to make/find own of the correct length;
longer than `pl-2*dx = pl - 23mm`. The 'safety pin' isnt included either.
I used another print that wasnt useful i heated a nail through.

The default one contains a logo and fancy hollowing out, this is configurable
with openscad, `spool_plank_plain.stl` has it removed.
