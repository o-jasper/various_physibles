# Parameteric hook-kindah thing you slide on plank

<img src="pics/plank_rod.jpg" alt="image of the thing">

The thickness of plank it is made for is 18.5mm, this has to fit the 
plank you're using. If your plank is a little thinner you can use
(sufficiently high friction, like mask-) tape to make it clamp better.

If it is too far off you'll have to use the .scad file yourself.
