# Stuff that slides on planks

## Horizontal rod holding thing
Cares about plank thickness and minimum distance from the wall. 
You have to provide a sufficiently long rod to stick underneath.
(as usual  you can use tape/file a bit)  

The rod isnt in there you have to make/find own of the correct length;
longer than `pl-2*dx = pl - 23mm`. The 'safety pin' isnt included either.
(Its from another print i heated a nail through)

## Parameteric ook-kindah thing you slide on plank

The thickness of plank it is made for is 18.5mm, this has to fit the 
plank you're using. If your plank is a little thinner you can use
(sufficiently high friction, like mask-) tape to make it clamp better.

If it is too far off you'll have to use the .scad file yourself.
