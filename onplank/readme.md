# Stuff that slides onto planks

* `spool_plank/` holds horizontal rod under plank.

* `plank_hook/` plain hook-kindah thing for under plank.

* `clamp_hanger/` puts a clamp under a plank, i use it to hold stuff i can 
  read without taking space on the table.

## Parameters
In order of importance:

`pt` is the plank thickness.

`pl` is the plank length.

`wd` is the distance from the wall.

`gl` is how far it slides onto the plank.

`t` is typically the thickness around the plank. Other thicknesses may relate to
 it.

## TODO
Wedges to slide between the plank and the clamp, so the clamp thickness
matters less. People can make overly high clamps and put these wedges in to make
it fit.

Maybe it should have a hole so these slides cant really move.
I put a hole `clamp_hanger` for this reason. 
TODO it is round, should be square so it cant rotate.
