# Clamp for holding paper onto a plank
I may use paper to draw designs on, but translating it to openscad or whatever,
it just doesnt seem like there is a good place to put it.. Under the plank is again
where would it be easily looked at but unobtrusive.

Works pretty well for me, though i do have to push the paper high enough so it
doesnt get friction. I also needed to use rubber bands to grip it better. 
None of the tape i had had enough grip, though some improved on the plastic.
(And it has to be thick enough.)

## Instructions
* Check the size of your plank, you could use the .scad file and set your side or
  use something to pad it up.

* Find some elastic bands that arent slippery, and a (small)cable tie to hold it down.

* Print the design.

* Put the elastic band through the hole one the 'immobile pad'. hold it down at 
  the top with the cable tie. There are also notches/holes on the other side, but
  that might not be needed.
  
* Try it, check that wobbling it doesnt make stuff slide down and fall.
  (it shouldnt if you pushed it up quite a bit.
