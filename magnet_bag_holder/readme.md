# Bad holders with magnets
Magnets today maybe hooks or screws tommorow!

Basically they hold those ziplock bags, and have magnets to stay in place 
themselves.

### Features

* Indicate the circumference with `cl`, it'll calcuate the radius.

* Holes that accept poles for extension. Default `fd=25`mm (straight-line)
  separation, radius of holes `fr=2`.
  
* corners reinforced a bit. Possibly with a thing with a 'sharp' edge to wipe stuff off.
  
* cheaper version 10cm^3 vs 25.5cm^3 

### Ideas
* Fairly sure the 'expensive version would work. Test cheaper version.
* Stuff for the holes.
+ Pen holders.
+ Clamps.
