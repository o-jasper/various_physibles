# Bag holders
Bag holders for ziplock bags(may work on other types too.

There are cylindrical holes for magnets and clamps too.

### Features

* Indicate the circumference with `cl`, it'll calcuate the radius.

* Holes that accept poles for extension. Default `fd=25`mm (straight-line)
  separation, radius of holes `fr=2`.
  
* corners reinforced a bit. Possibly with a thing with a 'sharp' edge to wipe
  stuff off.

* It can add cylinders to the feet in case you worry them coming off.
  But a setting like slicers 'avoid crossing perimeters' may prevent little 
  pieces of mess from accumulating to be hit int he first place.

### Ideas
* Fairly sure the 'expensive version would work. Test cheaper version.
* Stuff for the holes like pen holders.
* Could probably skimp more.
