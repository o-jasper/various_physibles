Bag holders for ziplock bags(may work on other types too.

There are cylindrical holes for magnets and clamps too.

Unfortunately due to extrusion difficults i havent been able to test anything
other than what is effectively the 'vanilla' thing. I have no need for any more,
so wont be testing myself.

### Caveits
If the magnets are too strong, friction not large enough it will annoyingly keep
sliding down. Also you have to get the clamping action of the bag right. It is
*not* good enough imo.

### Features

* Indicate the circumference with `cl`, it'll calcuate the radius.

* Holes that accept poles for extension. Default `fd=25`mm (straight-line)
  separation, radius of holes `fr=2`.
  
* corners reinforced a bit. Possibly with a thing with a 'sharp' edge to wipe
  stuff off.

* It can add cylinders to the feet in case you worry them coming off.
  But a setting like slicers 'avoid crossing perimeters' may prevent little 
  pieces of mess from accumulating to be hit int he first place.

### Ideas
* Fairly sure the 'expensive version would work. Test cheaper version.
* Stuff for the holes like pen holders.
* Could probably skimp more.
