# Clamp for holding paper onto a plank
I may use paper to draw designs on, but reading it while using the laptop, 
it gets in my way. So i put yet another thing to clamp onto the plank.

Works okay for me, but dont find it good enough over-all. I have to push the paper
high enough so it doesnt slide loose too easily.
(the paper block has to be thick enough too.)
I also needed to use rubber bands to grip it better. None of the tape i had had
enough grip, though some did better than the plastic.

## Instructions
* Check the size of your plank, you could use the .escad file and set your side or
  use something to pad it up. It works with [implicitscad](http://www.implicitcad.org/)
  and [openscad](http://www.openscad.org/), with the latter things arent rounded though.

* Find some elastic bands that arent slippery, and a (small)cable tie to hold it down.

* Print the design.

* Put the elastic band through the hole one the 'immobile pad'. hold it down at 
  the top with the cable tie. There are also notches/holes on the other side, but
  that might not be needed.
  
* Try it, check that wobbling it doesnt make stuff slide down and fall.
  (it shouldnt if you pushed it up quite a bit.)
