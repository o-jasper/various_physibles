NOTE: Probably would do it completely differently now..

# Holder for E motor
**Untested**. The idea if this object is to make the E motor removable.

Worries about it: (potentially change design)

* Can it hold it in despite the torque?
  + Smaller bottom hole, bigger corners ontop.
  + Clamp a bit from the sides.

* Top corners seem tiny to hold it.

* In the reprappro the back is awfully near the z-rod.
    + make back smaller?
