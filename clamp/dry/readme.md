# Clamps
Simple all-printed clamps for (for instance)drying clothing, print a pair of
them, and mate the pegs together.

The pegs are not meant to go together easily, they're not meant to separate
again. You might want to file them a little and use pliers. In the future i'll try
[this configuration](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25587) of keeping the parts 
together.
