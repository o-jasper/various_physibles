# Clamps
Clamps inspired on [thingiverse user KidCrazy](http://www.thingiverse.com/KidCrazy/designs)'s
['KCS' clamp](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:89457). Untested. Intended improvements are:

* Made it parametric.
* Guides to center it.
* Holes to glue some filament on in order to hold a regular spring instead of a
  plastic one.
* (optional, parametric)Gap behind the teeth improves hold on clothing.

## Instructions
Print it, the `_set.stl` files contains a pair with the plastic spring,
`_pair.stl` without. 

Then put the parts together, it will resist a bit halfway due to the guide. 
Going in diagnonally seems to work better.

If you use the plastuc spring, just put it in.

For regular springs there are probably multiple good strategies. 
* use metal wires and twisting them up, the spring then goes over the metal wires.

* fuse bits of filament with the hot end, this was my initial plan 
  but it didnt work well for me.

* You could probably also just tie it with wire but i am not so sure how well 
  that works. 

* Risk using nothing. Spring has friction with the plastic. There are also cones
  where the spring can go.
