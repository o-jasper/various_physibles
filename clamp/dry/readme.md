# Clamps
Clamps inspired on [thingiverse user KidCrazy](http://www.thingiverse.com/KidCrazy/designs)'s
['KCS' clamp](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:89457). Untested. Intended improvements are:

* Made it parametric.
* Guides to center it.
* Holes to glue some filament on in order to hold a regular spring instead of a
  plastic one.
* (optional, parametric)Gap behind the teeth improves hold on clothing.
