# Stuff for pants:

## Complete belt.
Current version uses a screw and friction, however taking it off is 
inconvenient, the nut has to be completely removed.

Also it uses wires to hold everything together. Seems to work fine, still,
Perhaps something interlocking is neater.

## Patch
Had a belt that kindah broke. So made these patches, will sew through the holes
to attach one on both sides.

There is a 'plain' batch' thingy, `plain.blend` contains one modified to
be easy to use the blender sculpt tool. There are other sculpt tools that do as
well, btw.

There is also one with the openhardware logo. Maybe in the future some more..
