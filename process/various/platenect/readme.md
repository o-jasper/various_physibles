The idea is that you can construct things by connecting plates to eachother,
for closets and stuff.

`corner_cut.scad` uses one corner cut so both sides can be connected. 
However, no good idea how to print it yet. 

I could also decrease the ammount of material used a bit. 
(the rounding box can only go so far.)
