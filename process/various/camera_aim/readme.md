`servo_holder` bottom, goes into the base.

`side_servo` goes onto that

`side_camera` onto that, however it is quite likely you will need another 
design depending on you camera. The design here leaves a lot to be desired.

Showing it off uses a [9G Servo model](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29734)
by thingiverse user [TheCase](http://www.thingiverse.com/TheCase/). To use it 
copy/symlink it from the directory of this design.

## TODO
* Readme doesnt say enough.
* Got some arduino code for it.. Could be placed here, kindah need a program
  that can control it more conveniently.
