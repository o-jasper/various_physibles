Printable book sides. The makefile can turn `.svg` into openscad surfaces
that the book can use. Height is determined by turning into black/white.
(dont assume pictures come out the way you expect, look at the result before 
printing)

# TODO: 
* one that really is *completely* based on svgs for profiles on all
  sides. Even the inside i suppose, although those are harder to get out nicely.
* Manage the size of the thing better.
* Wish openscad had a thingie that allowed people to enter parameters more easily.
* `surface` seems to like eating memory too much, potentially.
