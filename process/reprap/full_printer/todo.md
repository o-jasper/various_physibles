Figure all the todo items:

* Sliders for bed corner holders.

* X motion parts, align visualization of the bars..(including sliders)
* Y motion part.

* Get the makefile the same as the other ones.

Plates: one is 4mm or option 3.3mm, both seem to flex a little more than i would
want..

## Did

* Fix flex on top. Well, allowed for additions to ensure i can fix it if the 
  flex turns out too much.

* (big-ish changes) Pulley system, fix issues with wires getting in the way,
  and the awkward tower thing.. - turned into thing that clamps onto rods.
