# J-head holder for quickfit and 

`jh_holder.stl` is the dual J-head holder for 'mini quickfit'.
(also to be used if you just want one)
`jh_holder_quickfit.stl` is for the actual quickfit by richrap, however it 
has not been tested.

You slide the j-head in sideways and then it drops a bit, a slider
(`jh_sliver.stl`) can optionally be used to hold onto it, hwoever if it is 
held down by the pusher this wont be needed.

### The pusher
The pusher - pushes a pfte tube down into the J-head, M3 screws go through the pusher
and `jh_holder.stl` do so. Currently it is designed for a bowden setup. 
A second pfte tube with a M5 nut screwed onto the end is inserted from the side.

The pusher is split up into `jh_pusher_bottom.stl` and `jh_pusher_top.stl`, 
the latter has a slot on the side. These halves are pressed
together with the same screwing action as the pusher pushes down with, and that 
pushes the M5 nut close bit too.

`jh_pusher_top.stl` is made so you only need to unscrew a bit and it can then 
slide sideward.

Once the pusher is pushing the external pfte tube for bowden use should be still
able to removed or reinstalled, if the filament is retracted first.

## TODO/NOTE
* Fan side attachment.

Note: not sure if i will continue very far..

* No testing on the 3mm version, tell me how it went if you try it.
* Figure out a way to make everything epically clear, with diagrams and shit.
