# Rotating wheel for on filament.

Idea is a wheel that sits on the filament, rotating as the filament goes by.

The cup on one end could also contain a bit of a dust catcher, and/or the
included leeway.

### The leeway
Some filament tends to curl up and break itself if left alone. A tight-fitting
tube can avoid the breakage, but the the filament tends to break at the point
the tube touches the entrance to the filament pusher. The leeway keeps the tube
at a distance so the filament can bend a bit, but not too much.

### Printing notes:
Some of the prints have pretty small footprints, brim may be advisable.

Of course you only need one of the hanger or leeway objects, the basic and
'prettified' versions are basically there for some choice without having to edit
yourself.
