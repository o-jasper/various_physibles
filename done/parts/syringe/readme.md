# Syringes
I am pretty sure i will want to i experiment with paste or some such extrudes.
Syringes are an obvious place to start(though tube-fed paste extruders exist)

Looking for syringes i might buy, i thought, why not print the damned things.

They will need a rubber or something to hold it, i have yet to test options.
(like a bit of balloon, or a condom)

**Obviously** any printed syringes are *not* good for medical purpose until
proven otherwise. I retract all responsibilities i can. I am just providing some
geometries, no suitability implied..
