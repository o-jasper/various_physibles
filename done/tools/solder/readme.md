*note* obviously soldering irons can get very hot! Be careful and make sure it
is stable and you are not surprised by how much heat gets out of this thing.
I am **NOTE** convinced this thing is good enough!

**AT YOUR OWN RISK**

# Soldering iron holder
The idea is that the tin can and dissipates the heat, and wires inside
prevent the soldering iron from touching the tin can directly, making 
spots of it very hot.

### A **lot** to be desired!!
However, it does *not* quite succeed, the outside can still probably get very
hot, but no melting seen yet.

Also it **needs** sufficient weight in the bottom to be stable!

A lot remains to be desired from the design. Entering the internal wires are 
a pain in the ass, it is way oversized, and maybe some kind of housing would be good.
Further, i am not convinced it always holds the soldering iron well, and if the 
top of the soldering iron gets too hot, there is PLA to melt there. Additionally it
is rather oversized.

More minorly, somehow the connection gets it at the wrong angle. It took quite a
lot of force to get it on.(which is fine) It is not that much of a problem though.

### Ideas
Proceeding further, probably trying going for two nested tin cans, and a cage 
around the can so even if it does get hot, there is some protection.
Though that cage shouldnt be *too* thermally insolating.
