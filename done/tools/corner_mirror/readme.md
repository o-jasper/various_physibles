For if you're trying to look around corners.

# Instructions
Careful! Glass can be sharp, and it can break and then be sharper. Avoid high
forces.

* Print one stick and three corners.

* Clear the plastic out where the glass goes.(down to the corners) Especially 
the one with the stick on it.

* Clear out the holes in the bulbous things. (So putting the wire in is easy.)

* Put the corners on the mirror completely. Careful not to break it/cut yourself.

* Find some wire to hold it together, i used steel wire but maybe nylon, fishing
or kite wire is better.

* Wire it together. Do not try to force the corners onto mirror in this process,
less force to just put those on by hand.

# Other
Considered cdroms as mirror however the fringes thing make it hard to look 
through. Only good viewing if you're looking at things brighter than your
location.
