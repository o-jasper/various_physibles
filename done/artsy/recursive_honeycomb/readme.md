# Recursive honeycomb
Smaller and smaller honeycombs.. 

Note: probably want brim.

There are also some modifications that would make it better, 

* Making the smaller cones a bit thicker.
* Recursion adds self-overlapping shit, really loops doing the planes would do
  better performance wise. I just let my computer churn at it a bit, but if you
  want a `recursive_honeycomb_5.stl` it'd probably need the modification.
