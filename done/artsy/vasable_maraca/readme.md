(note: i find this thing.. boring)

# [Maraca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraca) that can be printed with zero infill
Can be printed with just one perimeter.(bottom layers should also be enabled)

`shaker.scad` is derived from [this](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:70744/)
by thingiverse user [bitswype](http://www.thingiverse.com/bitswype).

This stuff can also be found [o-jasper/various_physibles](https://github.com/o-jasper/various_physibles/tree/master/artsy/vasable_maraca) at github.

### Notes
I printed it with one layer but `slic3r`s(0.9.10b) 
`avoid_crossing_perimeters` got it outside the whole item causing some ugliness there.

Of course you could just make vasable-maraca which is basically just a base shape,
stop mid print and chuck the noisemarkers in *then*.. 
Or [have bits you just poke loose](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14685).
