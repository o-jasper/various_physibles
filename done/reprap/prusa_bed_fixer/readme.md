Thing to fix the prusa mendel bed. Make sure the head doesnt hit it sideways!
I suggest you move the endstops so the print head stays above the bed. 
(And make sure the firmware limitations arent too wide)

The z-rods of most prusas spring in them that might help with collisions
vertically. (right?) Of course the z-end-stop does too.

Use spacers on top the calibrate it. 
This is not a convenient calibration method much, so hope it stays in calibration.

`output/bed_fixer_through.stl` has the hole all the way through.. 
It might be too weak, so it isnt defaultly made by the Makefile.
