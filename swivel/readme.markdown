## Swivel
I have *no* idea if this is actually printable and then works.

`swivel.scad` is a 'plain' swivel, `swivel-fill.scad` tries to fill whatever 
it rotating in, the idea is that it has less crud possibly getting in, and 
looks nicer.

## TODO
* Would it work? (And if yes, what size ranges)
* Want attachment 
  + for angle sensors or springs?
  + how to attach this thing to something.. Conventions for that exist?

### Bookmarks

* `git checkout 25e7d0b06596b2e860078da23a6b9acba21111ce swivel2.5d.scad`
  gets a small start to an older 2.5d version.
